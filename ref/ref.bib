	abstract = {Combined high-frequency transthoracic ultrasound, pulsed Doppler and color flow mapping were used to image and assess blood flow velocity in the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 56 consecutive patients. All patients subsequently underwent coronary angiography. The LAD was imaged in 19 patients (34\%), and the diameter was measured in 12 with high-quality images (mean diameter 1.8 mm {\textpm} 0.08). In 1 patient, the penetrating branches of the LAD were imaged. The distal LAD appeared normal by ultrasound in 18 patients, and a significant stenosis was detected in 1; angiography confirmed the ultrasound findings. There were no false negative results. Characteristic biphasic flow with higher velocities in diastole were noted in all 19 patients. Color flow mapping demonstrated normal laminar flow, except in the patient with a distal stenosis. Pulsed Doppler confirmed an increased velocity distal to the stenosis in this patient. This study is the first transthoracic evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of a coronary artery stenosis, and the first in vivo description of blood flow disturbance at a distal coronary stenosis in humans. The clinical use of this technique is limited, because only the distal portion of the LAD is visualized. However, it may provide a noninvasive means of assessing distal LAD diameter and blood flow, and changes in these parameters under a variety of physiologic, pharmacologic and interventional stimuli.},

	abstract = {Statistical models have shown considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting cardiac images. While a variety of statistical models have been proposed to improve the segmentation results, most of them are either static models (SMs), which neglect the temporal dynamics of a cardiac sequence, or generic dynamical models (GDMs), which are homogeneous in time and neglect the intersubject variability in cardiac shape and deformation. In this paper, we develop a subject-specific dynamical model (SSDM) that simultaneously handles temporal dynamics (intrasubject variability) and intersubject variability. We also propose a dynamic prediction algorithm that can progressively identify the specific motion patterns of a new cardiac sequence based on the shapes observed in past frames. The incorporation of this SSDM into the segmentation framework is formulated in a recursive Bayesian framework. It starts with a manual segmentation of the first frame, and then segments each frame according to intensity information from the current frame as well as the prediction from past frames. In addition, to reduce error propagation in sequential segmentation, we take into account the periodic nature of cardiac motion and perform segmentation in both forward and backward directions. We perform "leave-one-out" test on 32 canine sequences and 22 human sequences, and compare the experimental results with those from SM, GDM, and active appearance motion model (AAMM). Quantitative analysis of the experimental results shows that SSDM outperforms SM, GDM, and AAMM by having better global and local consistencies with manual segmentation. Moreover, we compare the segmentation results from forward and forward-backward segmentation. Quantitative evaluation shows that forward-backward segmentation suppresses the propagation of segmentation errors.},
